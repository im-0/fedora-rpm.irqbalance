# irqbalance is a daemon process that distributes interrupts across
# CPUS on SMP systems.  The default is to rebalance once every 10
# seconds.  There is one configuration option:
#
# ONESHOT=yes
#    after starting, wait for a minute, then look at the interrupt
#    load and balance it once; after balancing exit and do not change
#    it again.
ONESHOT=
